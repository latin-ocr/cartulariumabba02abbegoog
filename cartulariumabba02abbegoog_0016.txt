INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. xl

quite patent, alike from the preservation of the Freneh daed
printed as No. 576,Ι and from Gascoigne’s mention oi and
extracts from what he speaks of as “libri de Whitby” belong-
ing to the Cholmleya and other matters notieed in the peges
'oi these volumes. What they were, and what has become ol
them, are now matters of the marest speculation. Effectually
they do not exist.

Touching the other constituente of this volume, and passing
hythe French charter by Henry de Perey from Dodsworth,
and the two original charters connected with the Harnritage at ..
Dunsley‚ with no further special notice, the copies of account
Α rolla still preserved at Whitby, and of Young’s imperfect copy
oi yet others, and the extracts from the Archbiahops’ Registers·
are the most noteworthy. Both are full of interest, andos
interest of various kinds, and it is hard to say os one alasa that
it exceeds tha other in its claima upon our consideration. For
the permission to examine these Registers‚ and the facilitiea
afforded me in exacuting the task, I have to acknowledge
myself under great obligation to Messrs. Hudsou and Bnekle.
The civility and attention evinced at their office was remark-
able and uniform. vhe remainder of the material oi the
volume hasbeen pickedup in many places and derived from
the memoranda of many years, and it is not without a sort of
regret that the editor thus closes a task which has been his
pleasure and labour of love sor the last ten or elevan years—
thefirst transcriptos the Striekland copy-“ the Abhot'a Book'’
-having been made for hisown purposes in the years 1868
and 1869.
