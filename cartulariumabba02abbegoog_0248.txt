’ ¹ pe’cio τοι. Το be ‘read no doubt ss in the text. Youug translates it
“cetmoney (dues ior fishing·nets),” oi course mistslsenly, il the reading
sdopwd is correct: end thot it is msy be with some conlidence inserted
from two entries in o rent-roll of Gysbnrue Priory, belonging ιο Admirsl
Chelones, which, it is hoped, will be printed in the Gysburnc Chortulsry.
They occur under the loosl hesding of 'l'hormodeby (now Thornsby, nesi·
Stookton), snd sre ss follows 2-“Pro retibus pendendis spnd Heriohbsno,
. . . iiiiu salmones, rel eorum pretium: iuter Pinif. B. Msrioe et Diem psl-
msrum solvendos,” oud “Pro retibus pendendis in nandum with s like
Juymsnt. There oen be little or no question thet these cntries refer to nete
used in ths salmon-fishery in the Tees, sud that the nsts were scats-ness-
nets which ore suspended, or hung by sid oi the so-oolled ‘stokes’ There
cun be eqnslly little doubt thst menon und selmon-tront obcunded in the
Esls in the middle ages-they ιοοιη even now-ond thus nete like the
suspended ncts oi the 'l'ees would be in nse in the lower reaches ol the
Whitby river slso.

² What the lupeno ol herrings msy heve been is uncertain. Alsst con·
sisted (end consists) oi 10, 000, sud the price lor good herring seems to hove
varied between sbout ἐι snd ἕο, thet is, from 8s to 10s. per thousand.
Thess ‘lagenos' urs vulued st something orer ls. ecch, sud msy be supposed
therefors to hors contained about 100 ιο 125. Dr. Yon ng construes tbs word
‘lumem’ without comment. But it must hove been s very smsll borrel ιο
oontsin only so many herrings. Quite possibly it msy hove been s querter,
or evon s less portion oi s ‘borrei' Note the word “ kympe” in No 613s.

⁸This is the samo es “mixtilis,'' in No. 589, p. 560, but the English
word or neme employed instead oi the Latin trsnslstion. 'she word
blendoorm ior whest end rye mixed, is still in nse in the district, though
the growth ol the crop hes nearly or quite cessed. Ol. Sw. Disl. clauum,
mixed rys ond oste, Dan. tummim, meslin.
